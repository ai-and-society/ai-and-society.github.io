The MIT AI Ethics discussion group aims to facilitate interdisciplinary, institute-wide discussions about AI technologies and the concerns they motivate. We want to provide a space for people in the MIT community to ask questions, gather feedback on ideas or research, learn from others, and connect with a community engaged with these topics.
