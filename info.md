## About us

The MIT AI Ethics discussion group aims to facilitate interdisciplinary, institute-wide discussions about AI technology and the concerns they motivate. We want to provide a space for people in the MIT community to ask questions, gather feedback on ideas or research, learn from others, and connect with a community engaged with these topics. 

## Meeting schedule

We will be holding remote montly meetings through Fall 2020. The specific dates and times will be announced shortly. 

## Join the discussion

We welcome and encourage all members of the MIT community. Questions of AI ethics span engineering, humanities, business, and the sciences, so the more perspectives and thoughtful participants, the better! 

If you are interested in joining the dicussion, please add yourself to our [mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/ai-ethics) for the latest information. If you have articles or papers you would like to discuss, please contact the [organizing team](https://mitaiethics.github.io/organizers).
