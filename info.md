As artificial intelligence and autonomous machines become [increasingly important](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-reshapes-itself-stephen-schwarzman-college-of-computing-1015), it is crucial to examine the ethics, morals, and explainability of these systems.  To gain better understanding, we are starting an AI and ethics reading group. We will explore both foundational and recent literature on AI and ethics.

The group will be MIT-wide to encourage a community discussion. What are the pressing AI ethics questions of today? How can the MIT community contribute to this field?
