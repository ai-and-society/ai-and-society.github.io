As artificial intelligence and autonomous machines become [increasingly important](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-reshapes-itself-stephen-schwarzman-college-of-computing-1015), it is crucial to examine the ethics, morals, and explainability of these systems.  To gain better understanding, we are starting an AI and ethics reading group. We will explore both foundational and recent literature on AI and ethics.

The group will be MIT-wide to encourage a community discussion. What are the pressing AI ethics questions of today? How can the MIT community contribute to this field?

## Next meeting

Our next meeting is **Thurs May 9, 2019** from 5pm-6:30pm in (room TBD).

We are excited to have Adrienne Mannov leading this meeting. Adrienne is a social anthropologist who is visiting MIT from her postdoc in Denmark. She will be talking about an interdisciplinary project she has been working to help citizens engage in debate about their data security via virtual reality. This will be a great opportunity to walk through a design process (that involves multiple people of different backgrounds) for a specific project that deals with many of the issues we've touched on previously around data privacy, citizen's rights, and democratizing information.  We hope to see you there!
