The MIT AI Ethics discussion group aims to facilitate interdisciplinary, institute-wide discussions about AI technologies and the concerns they motivate. We want to provide a space for people in the MIT community to ask questions, gather feedback on ideas or research, learn from others, and connect with a community engaged with these topics. 

### Next Meeting

Our next meeting will be on <b>Thursday, September 23 from 4-5 pm ET</b> on Historical Roots of AI & Decolonial Theory. The meeting will be followed by a reception with food outdoors at 5 pm ET. 

Please RSVP ([here](https://forms.gle/2P2r6NscUpz3FWhq5)). 

### Meeting Format

This semester, weâ€™re trying something new. In particular, there will be two types of meetings, as follows:

* <b>Foundational Series</b>. These discussion-based meetings will focus on foundational texts. Attendees read through the texts before the meetings, then come together to discuss. 
* <b>Speaker Series</b>. These meetings will be led by one or two speakers. The speaker(s) will present a topic and/or reading, then open up the floor for questions and discussion. 

### Fall 2021 schedule

* September 23 - Foundational Series 1 - Decolonial AI
* October 7 - Speaker Series 1 - [Dr Stefan Helmriech](https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/stefan-helmreich) on Artificial Intelligence and the Ethics of Accuracy

* November 4 - Speaker Series 2 
* November 18 - Foundational Series 3
