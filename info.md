The UC Berkeley AI & Society Community is an interdisciplinary working group. Our goal is to create a space of researchers from many departments---computer science, information science, statistics, public policy, law, journalism and more--that work at the very broad intersection of “AI” and “humans” to interact, connect and exchange insights.
