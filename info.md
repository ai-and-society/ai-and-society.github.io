As artificial intelligence and autonomous machines become [increasingly important](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-reshapes-itself-stephen-schwarzman-college-of-computing-1015), it is crucial to examine the ethics, morals, and explainability of these systems.  To gain better understanding, we are starting an AI and ethics reading group. We will explore both foundational and recent literature on AI and ethics.

The group will be MIT-wide to encourage a community discussion. What are the pressing AI ethics questions of today? How can the MIT community contribute to this field?

## Next meeting

The next meeting will be **Wednesday Nov 28, 2018** from 6:30pm - 8:00pm in [room 32-144](https://whereis.mit.edu/?go=32).

We will be discussing AI ethics as it relates to anonymity and privacy. Our readings are:
 1. [Even Anonymous Coders Leave Fingerprints](https://www.wired.com/story/machine-learning-identify-anonymous-code/) which references the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.08546.pdf) that may be interesting background.
 2. [Facebook/Cambridge Analytica: Privacy lessons and a way forward](https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/blog-2018-fb-cambridgeanalytica/)

Thank you to Jack who volunteered to help lead this topic!
