The MIT AI and Ethics discussion group aims to facilitate interdisciplinary, institute-wide discussions about AI technology and the concerns they motivate. We want to provide a space for people in the MIT community to ask questions, gather feedback on ideas or research, learn about these topics, and find a community of other people interested in engaging. 

If you are interested in joining the dicussion, please join our [mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/ai-ethics) for the latest information.

## Summer 2020 meetings

We will be holding monthly meetings over the summer: June 18th, July 9th, August 13th. All meetings will take place from 4-5pm ET via Zoom.
