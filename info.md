The UC Berkeley AI & Society Community is an interdisciplinary working group. Our goal is to create a space of researchers from many departments---computer science, information science, statistics, public policy, law, journalism and more--that work at the very broad intersection of “AI” and “humans” to interact, connect and exchange insights. 


## Events
For Spring 2025, we are currently meeting every other Wednesday 5:30-7pm in [Soda 510](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gp2N9GjRPWgH232X6) with speakers, social mingling, and food at each session.

### Join the discussion

We welcome and encourage all members of the UC Berkeley community. Questions of AI and society span engineering, humanities, law, business, the sciences, and the social sciences, so the more perspectives and thoughtful participants, the better.
