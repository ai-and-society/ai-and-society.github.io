The MIT AI Ethics discussion group aims to facilitate interdisciplinary, institute-wide discussions about AI technologies and the concerns they motivate. We want to provide a space for people in the MIT community to ask questions, gather feedback on ideas or research, learn from others, and connect with a community engaged with these topics. 

### Next Meeting

Our next meeting will be on <b>February 18th from 5-6 pm ET</b> discussing Explainability and Interpretability! Please RSVP ([here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJhFfk8JQodzi3V0hZPpb1VZn_6jNolbFuqMQmULR4F8MgYQ/viewform)).
