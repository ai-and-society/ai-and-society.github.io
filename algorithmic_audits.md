[MIT AI Ethics](https://mitaiethics.github.io/) and the [MIT Science Policy Initiative](https://mitspi.squarespace.com/) co-host an event on algorithmic audits and their economic context.

{% include image.html url="/assets/algorithmic_audits.png" description="Algorithmic Audits in Economic Context." %}

Algorithmic audits as a tool for algorithmic accountability receive increasing attention by policymakers, and more work attempts to understand algorithmic properties. Algorithmic audits face multiple challenges: Data is hard to get for legal or technological reasons, and many of the questions of interest, be they about non-discrimination or non-self-preferencing are hard to operationalize. In this event, we hear from several experts studying algorithms in deployment in hiring, highlight how humans interact with algorithms, and how this affects auditing of algorithms in the future.

**Date:** Thursday, 12/01/2022

**Time:** 3:45 PM-6:00 PM

**Where:** MIT Stata Center, Kiva Room (32-G449)
