[MIT AI Ethics&Policy](https://mitaiethics.github.io/) and the [MIT Science Policy Initiative](https://mitspi.squarespace.com/) co-host an event on algorithmic audits and their economic context.

Algorithmic audits as a tool for algorithmic accountability receive increasing attention by policymakers, academics, and civil society. Such audits face multiple challenges: Data is hard to get, for legal or technological reasons, and many of the questions of interest, be they about non-discrimination or non-self-preferencing, are hard to operationalize. In this three-panel, we hear from several experts studying algorithms in deployment in hiring, highlight how humans interact with algorithms, and how this affects auditing of algorithms in the future.

**Date:** Thursday, 12/01/2022

**Time:** 3:45 PM-6:00 PM

**Where:** MIT Stata Center, Kiva Room (32-G449)
