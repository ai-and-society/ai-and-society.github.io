We spent the first half of this meeting going over the goals of the groups, logistics, and intros. In the second half, we talked about auditing. The paper people were asked to read was [Closing the AI Accountability Gap: Defining an End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing, by Raji et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00973.pdf)
