We welcome and encourage all members of the MIT community. Questions of AI ethics span engineering, humanities, business, and the sciences, so the more perspectives and thoughtful participants, the better! We expect all reading group members to conduct themselves in a respectful, inclusive, and considerate manner.

<a href="http://harinisuresh.com/">Harini Suresh</a> is PhD student in computer science at MIT. She is particularly interested in studying how complications arise when machine learning is used with imperfect real-world data, and building tools that surface possible concerns to end users. She did her undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT as well, and worked on developing interpretable methods for predicting onset and weaning of invasive interventions for patients in Intensive Care Units. She has spent summers working at Google Brain, Jawbone, and Zephyr Health. Outside of research, she loves doing aerial arts, baking all kinds of things, and reading.
