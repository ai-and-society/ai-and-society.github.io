We welcome and encourage all members of the MIT community. Questions of AI ethics span engineering, humanities, business, and the sciences, so the more perspectives and thoughtful participants, the better! We expect all reading group members to conduct themselves in a respectful, inclusive, and considerate manner.

<a href="http://irenechen.net">Irene Chen</a> is a PhD student at MIT in EECS in the <a href="http://clinicalml.org">Clinical Machine Learning Group</a>. Her research focuses on building machine learning methods that to solve questions in health care and fairness. Before MIT, she received her AB/SM from Harvard and worked at Dropbox for two years as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and Chief of Staff. In her free time, she enjoys broccoli and long distance running.

<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/lgilpin/">Leilani H. Gilpin</a> is a PhD student in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at MIT.  Her area of focus is explanatory artificial
intelligence, which enables autonomous vehicles, and other autonomous
machines to explain themselves. She is currently working on a Toyota
Research Initiative Project, “The Car Can Explain!” in the Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab under the supervision of
Professor Gerald Jay Sussman.  Before returning to academia, Leilani
worked at Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and earned a M.S. from Stanford University and a  B.S. in Mathematics (with honors),
B.S. in Computer Science (with highest honors), and a music minor from
UC San Diego in 2011.

<a href="http://harinisuresh.com/">Harini Suresh</a> is a PhD student in EECS at MIT. She's particularly interested in the complications and societal implications that arise when machine learning is used with imperfect real-world data. Harini did her undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT as well, and worked on developing interpretable methods for predicting onset and weaning of invasive interventions for patients in Intensive Care Units. She also likes photography and making/eating bread.

<a href="http://aceituno.mit.edu/">Bernardo Aceituno</a> is an SM student in Mechanical Engineering at MIT. His research interests lie in the area of robotic manipulation. In particular, he studies applications of optimization and AI to mitigate the effects of uncertainty in precise and safe manipulation tasks. Bernardo did his undergrad at Universidad Simon Bolivar (USB), Venezuela, where he worked on locomotion of quadruped robots over rough terrains, also in collabaoration with Toyota Research Institute (TRI) and Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT).
