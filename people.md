<a href="http://harinisuresh.com/">Harini Suresh</a> graduated from MIT with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, and she's sticking around for her PhD. She's particularly interested in alogrithmic fairness -- how to make machine learning algorithms more understandable and easier to use responsibly. Her past research focused on predicting intervention onset and weaning with ICU timeseries data. She's spent a couple summers enjoying the West Coast as a data science intern at Jawbone and Zephyr Health. She also love traveling, hiking, farmer's markets, cooking, taking photographs, and reading.
